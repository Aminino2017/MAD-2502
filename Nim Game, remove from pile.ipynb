    "Write a function game(), which enables a user to play the following game against the computerâ€”the computer must always win if it has the first move:  The game starts with a pile of 39 coins being on the table. Now the first player may remove 1, 2 or 3 coins. Then the second player may remove 1, 2 or 3 coins, then the first Player may remove 1, 2 or 3 coins etc. The player taking the last coin wins."
